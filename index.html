     <p class="first">what is css?</p>
<ol type="1">
    <li>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheet</li><br>
    <li>CSS describes how HTML elements are to be on screen, paper or in other media</li>
    <br>
    <li> <span class="two"> Css is not neccesary</span>  <span class="one"> CSS saves a lot of work. </span> It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once</li>
    <br>
    <li id="p1">External stylesheets are stored in CSS files.</li>
</ol>
<p class="first">CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Inline - by using the style attribute inside HTML elements</li>
    <li>Internal - by using a style element in the head section</li>
    <li>External - by using a link element to link to an external CSS file.</li>
    <li>The most common way to add CSS. is to keep styles in external CSS files. However, <span class="one"> in this <br>
         tutorial we will use inline and internal styles, </span> because this is easier to demonstrate, and easier for you to try it yourself.</li>
</ul>
<p>When comparing CSS class vs ID, the difference is that CSS class applies a multiple elements. ID, on the other hand, applies a style to one unique element. ID is also <br>
   special in that you can use a special URL, to link directly to an element and it`s used by JavaScript. <br><br>
   In CSS, selections are used to target a specific element or range of elements on a web page. Once an element has been targeted, a style or set of styles can be applied to the <br>
   element. <br><br>
   There is a wide range of selectors available. two of the most commonly used are class and ID. Both are used to target elements to which a style should be applied. </p>
